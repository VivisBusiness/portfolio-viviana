    description: `I am a software developer with a background in electronic engineering and a strong focus on frontend technologies. 
    My main stack includes Angular, React.js, React Native, TypeScript, and Sass, with experience building modern, accessible, and responsive user interfaces. 
    I am currently expanding my backend skills with Node.js, NestJS, and MongoDB, and I have basic knowledge of Java with Spring Boot.
    I stand out for being self-taught, detail-oriented, and committed to code quality and continuous improvement. 
    I work confidently with tools such as Git, GitHub, Azure DevOps, Postman, and Figma, and I enjoy contributing to collaborative environments with clean, efficient, and user-focused solutions.`,
