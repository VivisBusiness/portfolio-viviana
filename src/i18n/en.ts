    description: `I am a software developer with a background in electronic engineering and a strong focus on frontend technologies. 
    My main stack includes Angular, React.js, React Native, TypeScript, and Sass, with experience building modern, accessible, and responsive user interfaces. 
    I am currently expanding my backend skills with Node.js, NestJS, and MongoDB, and I have basic knowledge of Java with Spring Boot.
