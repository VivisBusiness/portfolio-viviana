    title: "About Me",
    description: `Hi! I’m Viviana Moreno Gordillo, a software developer with strong experience in frontend development and currently pursuing a degree in Systems Engineering. Over the past 4 years, I’ve been involved in the design and development of modern, accessible, and responsive web and mobile interfaces using technologies like ReactJS, Angular, React Native, TypeScript, and Sass.
    I’ve contributed to large-scale projects for companies like McKinsey & Company and BITS Americas, building transactional portals, mobile applications, and digital platforms with a strong focus on user experience. One of my key strengths is ensuring web accessibility (WCAG), making sure that the products I build are inclusive and usable for everyone.
    Currently, I’m expanding my skills into backend development, working with Node.js, NestJS, and MongoDB, and I have a foundational knowledge of Java and Spring Boot, allowing me to approach projects with a broader technical perspective.
    I’m confident using tools like Git, GitHub, Azure DevOps, Postman, Figma, Android Studio, Xcode, and Swagger, keeping my workflow clean, efficient, and user-centered.
    I’m a self-taught, detail-oriented, and highly motivated developer who enjoys learning new technologies, collaborating in agile teams, and building solutions that make a difference.`,
